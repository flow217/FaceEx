Start Application on a Local Server:
As FaceEx is a Application that needs to be served as a Webpage and is used within a browser environment the files have to be hosted on a webserver.
If you want to use it on your local computer follow these steps:
1. Download the Release Folder.
2. Download and install a local Webserver, I recommend Servez as it is lightweight, well documented and simple to use. https://github.com/greggman/servez.
3. Install Servez as explained on the Repository.
4. Start Servez and choose the Release Folder
5. 5tart the Server, a Browser Tab will start automatically and present the Application
