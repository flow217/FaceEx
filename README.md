FaceEx is a Application that needs to be served as a webpage within a browser environment,so the files have to be hosted on a webserver.
If you want to use it on your local computer follow these steps:
1. Download the FaceEx_1_0_bundle.zip from the Releases.
2. Download and install a local webserver, I recommend Servez as it is lightweight, well documented and simple to use. https://github.com/greggman/servez.
3. Install Servez as explained on the repository.
4. Start Servez and choose the unpacked FaceEx_1_0_bundle folder.
5. 5tart the server, a browser tab will start automatically or press the Launch Browser button.
